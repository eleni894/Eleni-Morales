          <p class="tleft">
          Continuing my tradition from the previous summer, I painted another mural in my elementary school. This mural is a reminder to students that school is a safe environment to follow their dreams in.

        <p class="tright">
        In a two week project, I painted a mural in the kindergarten area of my school. My friends and I persevered through the sun, rain, and humidity to create a masterpiece on two walls and six doors. I am beyond happy with the end result!

        <p class="tleft">
        Recently I went to a woman's club to guide attendees through my painting of Mickey and Minnie. We sketched, painted, and bonded together. I was able to share my passion for art and Disney with a wonderful group of welcoming women.

        <p class="tright">
        This two-week endeavor involved upcycling a plain-white door to a collage of Disney paintings. Every art piece required minuscule details and vibrant colors to bring infamous characters to life. Enjoy!

        I painted the beloved Stitch with his frog friend in front of Hawaii's beautiful landscapes. This is one of my best art pieces. The detail put into Stitch and the frog is immaculate.

        <p class="tright">
        After receiving a red plant pot, I was inspired to create a Mickey topiary. The end product clearly resembles Mickey and would be the perfect addition to Epcot's flower festival.

      <p class="tleft">
        Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, Piglet, and Roo are painted enjoying a beautiful day and each other's company. Winnie the Pooh is a timeless tale that deserves recognition for teaching people of all ages the importance of friendship.

      <p class="tright">
        Lady and the Tramp enjoy spaghetti in front of a starry night sky. While the spaghetti is a bit cartoonish, it shows the development of my art skills. I evolved from questionable spaghetti to murals of gorgeous Disney characters.

        The "Mine!" birds of Finding Nemo will always hold a special place in my heart. Painting each individual bird was a tedious task, but the end result was well worth it.
